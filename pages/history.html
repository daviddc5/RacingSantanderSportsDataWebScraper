              <h3>The Founding Years</h3>
              <p>
                Real Racing Club de Santander was founded on 14 June 1913. Its
                first match was a local derby, a sign of the passionate support
                that would define the club for over a century. The "Real"
                (Royal) title was granted by King Alfonso XIII in 1914,
                solidifying its prestigious status early in its existence.
              </p>

              <h3>Founders of La Liga</h3>
              <p>
                Racing de Santander holds a special place in Spanish football
                history as one of the ten founding clubs of La Liga in 1929. The
                team finished the inaugural season in last place but avoided
                relegation by winning a playoff, a dramatic start to their
                top-flight journey. The early decades saw them competing with
                the giants of Spanish football.

              <h3>European Adventures</h3>
              <p>
                One of the most glorious periods came in the 2007-08 season
                under manager Marcelino Garc√≠a Toral. The team finished 6th in
                La Liga, their best-ever finish, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for
                the first time in their history. The subsequent European
                campaign, where they faced teams like Manchester City and Paris
                Saint-Germain, is remembered fondly by all fans as a testament
                to the club's potential.
