## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

### Change Team ID

If you want to use this for a different team, update the `teamId` in both API configurations.

### Modify Fallback Data

Edit the `getFallbackData()` method in `footballAPIData.js` to customize the offline data.

### Adjust API Settings

- **Enable/Disable APIs**: Set `enabled: true/false` for each API
- **Change Default API**: Modify `this.currentAPI = 'apiFootball'`
- **Add More APIs**: Extend the `apiConfig` object

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"API key invalid"**

- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you've subscribed to the API service
- Check your API quota hasn't been exceeded

**"No data showing"**

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify JavaScript is enabled
- Test with fallback data (should always work)

**"CORS errors"**

- API-Football and Football-Data.org support CORS
- If using a different API, you may need a proxy

**"Rate limit exceeded"**

- Check your API plan limits
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan
- The fallback data will show when limits are reached

### Debug Mode:

Add this to `footballAPIData.js` for detailed logging:

```javascript
// Add at the top of the class
const DEBUG = true;

// Add in fetch methods
if (DEBUG) {
  console.log("API Response:", data);
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### API-Football:

- **Free**: 100 requests/day (sufficient for development)
- **Basic**: $10/month - 1,000 requests/day
- **Pro**: $25/month - 10,000 requests/day

### Football-Data.org:

- **Free**: 10 requests/minute (good for testing)
- **Tier One**: $25/month - 50 requests/minute
- **Tier Two**: $50/month - 100 requests/minute

### Recommendation:

Start with the free tiers for development, upgrade when going live.

## üöÄ Deployment

### For Production:

1. Get a paid API plan for reliable data
2. Set up proper error monitoring
3. Consider caching strategies for better performance
4. Test thoroughly with real API data

### For Development:

1. Use free API tiers
2. Rely on fallback data for offline development
3. Test API integration periodically

The solution is fully responsive and includes:

- Mobile-friendly player cards
- Touch-optimized fixture displays
- Responsive league position cards
- Optimized loading states for mobile

## üîÑ Auto-Refresh

The data loads automatically when pages load. For real-time updates, you could add:

```javascript
// Refresh data every 5 minutes
setInterval(loadMatchData, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify API keys** are correct and active
3. **Test with fallback data** to ensure the site works
