# Deployment Guide - Navigation Fixes

## Problem Solved

Your website navigation wasn't working on Vercel and GitHub Pages because these platforms don't handle direct navigation to routes like `/pages/squad.html` properly. When users clicked links or refreshed pages, they would get 404 errors.

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`vercel.json`** - Configuration for Vercel hosting (UPDATED)
2. **`package.json`** - Project configuration for Vercel (NEW)
3. **`_redirects`** - Configuration for Netlify and similar platforms
4. **`404.html`** - Custom 404 page for GitHub Pages routing
5. **`js/router.js`** - Centralized routing utility
6. **`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`** - This guide

### Files Modified:

1. **`components/header.html`** - Updated to use the new router
2. **`index.html`** - Added router script
3. **`pages/squad.html`** - Added router script
4. **`pages/history.html`** - Added router script

## How the Fix Works

### 1. Server-Side Configuration

- **Vercel**: The `vercel.json` file tells Vercel to treat this as a static site and handle routing correctly
- **GitHub Pages**: The `404.html` file acts as a fallback that redirects users to the correct page
- **Netlify**: The `_redirects` file handles routing for Netlify hosting

### 2. Client-Side Routing

- The `js/router.js` file provides a centralized way to handle navigation
- It automatically detects the hosting environment and adjusts paths accordingly
- It ensures consistent navigation across all pages

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` and `package.json` configuration
4. Deploy - navigation should work immediately

**Important**: Make sure to set the following in Vercel project settings:

- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: Leave empty or set to `echo 'Static site'`
- **Output Directory**: Leave empty (Vercel will serve files from root)

### For GitHub Pages:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select your branch and folder (usually `/` or `/docs`)
4. Deploy - the `404.html` will handle routing

### For Netlify:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically detect the `_redirects` file
4. Deploy - navigation should work immediately

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, test these scenarios:

1. ✅ Click navigation links (should work)
2. ✅ Refresh any page (should not show 404)
3. ✅ Use browser back/forward buttons (should work)
4. ✅ Direct URL access (e.g., `yoursite.com/pages/squad.html`)

## Troubleshooting

If navigation still doesn't work:

1. **Check file paths**: Ensure all script paths are correct
2. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or clear browser cache
3. **Check console**: Open browser dev tools and look for JavaScript errors
4. **Verify deployment**: Make sure all files were uploaded to your hosting platform

### Vercel Specific Issues:

- **Missing public directory**: The updated `vercel.json` should fix this
- **Missing build script**: The `package.json` provides dummy build scripts
- **Framework detection**: Set Framework Preset to "Other" in Vercel settings
